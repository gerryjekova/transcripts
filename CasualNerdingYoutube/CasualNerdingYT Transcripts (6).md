Okay, hold up, Александр, if you’re out there making a reaction to my 8th March video—y’know, the one where I was feeding you and repping the ladies—don’t you dare roast me\! 😤 If you’re a dude writing this stuff, either you’re rocking women’s clothes, snagged some random chick’s username, or you’re just tryna stir the pot for clout. Or maybe it’s straight-up discrimination\! Nah, I’m too small-time for that drama. *One video later*—BOOM, I put in the work, made a fire thumbnail, and it’s STRONG. Like, *really* strong. I’m vibing with it.

This is what it means to show up and SHINE. Went from being the “casual nerdy” streamer with the cringiest name ever—thanks to Александр translating my name to “Обикновено Задръстяната” (Casual Nerdy TV), which is SO not legit. Like, Casual Nerdy TV sounds like the worst possible name combo, or worse. Whoever wrote the Bulgarian dictionary deserves a fat L for this one. No lube, just straight-up pain. 🤦‍♀️

### Nerd vs. Зубър Rant

Real talk: “nerd” should be the *antonym* of “зубър” (bookworm). A nerd’s someone who’s obsessed with something, geeking out and learning it for the love of it, not because some prof’s grading them or they’re farming clout. A nerd’s in it for the passion. So where the hell did my name come from? *Casual Nerdy TV*. Check this—Александър’s translation of “nerding” is apparently “небрежно вманиачаване” (casual obsession). Yo, that actually keeps the English vibe\! Like, being casually obsessed? That’s me. But this thumbnail? “Loves sausages, hates tea”? What’s this title nonsense, and why isn’t Преслав tagged properly? If you think I care, you can \[\_\_\] the trash. 😜

### Beta Cucks and Stream Gossip

Please tell me you’re not part of *that* audience—the “beta cuck” crowd. Beta cucks, beta cuck wives, tiny bows on cuck vibes. Got it. *Евeто молиме*—is that the same Евeто? Nah, that’s Акалито. Too much info, brain overload. 😵 Wait, is this how I’m streaming? Yup. That chick you mentioned twice as Преслав’s girlfriend, Евелина? Is that her? The maniac? You can’t even read her name right to say it properly in the video. Pfft, *силендура*\! Wow, you’re out here disrespecting women, can’t even remember a name\! Are there *really* people who think I meant that ironic comment seriously and are mad about it?

### Anime Flex and Nose Respect

I clocked that Nine-Tailed Fox from *Naruto* in your intro flip-through, but I’m not softening up just ‘cause you’ve got anime taste. I’m not your ally, keep it moving. Learn my name, you oligofren\! I don’t know where you saw *Naruto* in a Marvel intro, but props to your nose cavity, fam. *Respect*. Those industrial quantities it’s handled? My hat’s off. *Шляз, шляз, пой попутката\!* Oof, is there a point? You out here doing drugs or what? Yo, hook me up with 3 kilos of whatever you’re on, please and thanks. 😏 Nah, I’m not spilling my Discord, cuties. You can’t bribe me to drop it just so you can hit me up at 2 a.m. with dirty talk. *Але късо*—new internet nickname, iconic.

### Roasting and Backhanded Compliments

If you rewind your brain 10 years, even 12-year-old me would be more coherent than you. Damn, you’re so *manly* putting bras on women. Why don’t they slap a muzzle on you to hold up those saggy \[**\] I’m staring at? Bro, I wanna \[**\] you. I wanna dig into—nah, I don’t even know what that is. 😅 Oh, FINALLY, this video’s waking up. Don’t you *dare* let this guy roll with saggy balls. I don’t care how small they are, how they’re tucked into some regis ball bra. I can’t, bro. What’d you make us watch? *Секу*, please. I just love messing around, pushing extremes to make y’all squirm. Sorry, not sorry. 😈 Feels touching, though, in a good way. My bad, it’s too strong.

### Contextless Rants and Лилия Начкова

Here’s another dude trying to say something without knowing the full context. No clue what you’re on about. My brain’s like my stream background right now—empty. In this video, I’m talking about Лилия Начкова and how she makes kids’ shows. Made a comment about her going braless. Like, you’re making content for kids, no biggie. When Кралски says it, everyone’s hyped, but when *I* say it, y’all wanna cancel me. My \[**\] are free, call the cops on these loose \[**\]\! Tell ‘em it’s a scandal. I’ll yeet it and slap it on your mom’s \[\_\_\]. Chill, what’d my mom do to you? *I love* your mom, that’s why. 😘 I’ve got a ton of comments about this creator’s content, but I’ll spare y’all. Making room for the *real* love.

### Gender Pronoun Dodge and Teen Confessions

You probably noticed I’ve been dodging pronouns for this content creator. That’s ‘cause they’re a formula with two unknowns. Honestly, that’s punishment enough. I’m the biggest problem, huh? “He hates different people\!” Nah, fam, when I was 13-14, I was *into* reading about two dudes falling in love, munching on each other’s \[\_\_\], blushing like crazy. Dunno why, but that was my first turn-on. Something’s wrong with me. 😳 Anyway, quick aside: AI-generated drawings? Not art. *This* is art—drawing Преслав’s mom in one minute. *Ga?* What’s good, Алекс? Look at this *Вятния свят* cutie\! Gonna eat him up, look at those cheeks, Гиретови. Go die. 😜

### Apology to Александр and Minecraft Roleplay Drama

Александър Вървежния, please accept my apologies for practicing my roleplay on you and making you my first victim. They still cut me out, though—guess there can only be *one* beta king in town, right, Преслав? *Twitch: CasualNerdyTV*. So, my streamer name wasn’t the only issue Преслав had. This whole thing was practice for my roleplay concept for Преслав’s Minecraft server, which I got cut from. I passed three rounds of trials, first two were fine. Then some idiot in the third round said I didn’t have enough roleplay experience to play the alignment I picked. So, I practiced on people with my content. My bad. 😅

But, Александр, you *maniac*, you’re not one of the people I’ve fed sincerely. I’ve fed some folks for real, but you? That was roleplay. I actually vibe with you, and if it helps, I’ll delete that video where I roasted you. I just wanted your attention somehow. I wanna be useful for your Twitch investigation. I know a bunch from the mod side, the streamer side. No other streamer’s pulling the crazy chat interactions and stream integrations I do. *Гльок, гългъл, гльок, гългъл, хаукту гългъл\!* Prove me wrong.

### Offering Help and Personal Anecdotes

I’d love to help you out, Александр. I’ve got a rough history with a love story that still hurts to talk about. Plus, I’ve got coding skills, love digging where I shouldn’t, and know how bots work—without paying for sites like QQB or whatever. There’s some shady sites out there, but I think I can be useful. *Фримири*\! Look at this cutie\! Oh, Яне, Яне, Яне, can’t skip Яне\! 😍

### Notes and Context

- **Stream Vibe**: The text is a chaotic, high-energy stream rant, mixing Bulgarian slang, internet culture, and personal anecdotes. It’s a blend of roasting, self-deprecation, and community engagement, typical of a Twitch streamer hyping their chat.
